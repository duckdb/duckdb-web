We are excited to announce the DuckDB London meetup, which will take place during the week of the prestigious [VLDB 2025 conference](https://vldb.org/2025/). This meetup will specifically focus on DuckDB's role in **Science and Education**.

## Call for Talks

We are looking for 5-minute lightning talk proposals, which discuss the use of DuckDB in research and education.
For example, you may present an abridged version of a VLDB paper that builds on DuckDB, or talk about your experience in using DuckDB for teaching SQL.

Please **[submit your talk proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetOiek3cWaJFyPAzgCO3hQZT-7WgYmSocZq0wIz7KYxUtL0Q/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=116827623339100062675)** until August 26 (Tuesday), Anywhere on Earth.
We'll notify the speakers by August 28 (Thursday).
