    `yardstick` implements Julian Hyde's "Measures in SQL" paper ([arXiv:2406.00251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00251)), adding measure-aware SQL to DuckDB.

    Measures are aggregations that know how to re-aggregate themselves when the query context changes. This enables:

    **Percent of total** calculations without CTEs or window functions:
    ```sql
    SEMANTIC SELECT region, AGGREGATE(revenue) / AGGREGATE(revenue) AT (ALL) AS pct
    FROM sales_v;
    ```

    **Year-over-year comparisons** with simple syntax:
    ```sql
    SEMANTIC SELECT year, AGGREGATE(revenue) AT (SET year = year - 1) AS prior_year
    FROM sales_v;
    ```

    **AT Modifiers**:
    - `AT (ALL)` - Grand total across all dimensions
    - `AT (ALL dim)` - Total excluding specific dimension
    - `AT (SET dim = val)` - Fix dimension to specific value
    - `AT (SET dim = expr)` - Fix dimension to expression
    - `AT (WHERE cond)` - Pre-aggregation filter
    - `AT (VISIBLE)` - Use query's WHERE clause
