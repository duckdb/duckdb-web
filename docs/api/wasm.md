# Getting Started with DuckDB-WASM

A great starting point is to read the [DuckDB-WASM launch blog post](https://duckdb.org/2021/10/29/duckdb-wasm.html)!

Another great resource is the [Github repository](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm).

For details, see the full [DuckDB-WASM API Documentation](https://shell.duckdb.org/docs/modules/index.html).
