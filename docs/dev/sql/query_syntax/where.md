title: WHERE Clause
---

The `WHERE` clause specifies any filters to apply to the data. This allows you to select only a subset of the data in which you are interested. Logically the `WHERE` clause is applied immediately after the `FROM` clause.

## Examples

```sql
-- select all rows that have id equal to 3
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE id = 3;
-- select all rows that match the given case-insensitive LIKE expression
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE name ILIKE '%mark%';
-- select all rows that match the given composite expression
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE id = 3 OR id = 7;
```
