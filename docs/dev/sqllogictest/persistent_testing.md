By default, all tests are run in in-memory mode (unless `--force-storage` is enabled). In certain cases, we want to force the usage of a persistent database. We can initiate a persistent database using the `load` command, and trigger a reload of the database using the `restart` command.

```sql
# load the DB from disk
load __TEST_DIR__/storage_scan.db

statement ok
CREATE TABLE test (a INTEGER);

statement ok
INSERT INTO test VALUES (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (NULL)

# ...

restart

query I
SELECT * FROM test ORDER BY a
----
NULL
11
12
13
14
15
```

Note that by default the tests run with `SET wal_autocheckpoint='0KB'` - meaning a checkpoint is triggered after every statement. WAL tests typically run with the following settings to disable this behavior:

```sql
statement ok
PRAGMA disable_checkpoint_on_shutdown

statement ok
PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint='1TB';
```
