title: Julia Package
---

The DuckDB Julia package provides a high-performance front-end for DuckDB. Much like SQLite, DuckDB runs in-process within the Julia client, and provides a DBInterface front-end.

The package also supports multi-threaded execution. It uses Julia threads/tasks for this purpose. If you wish to run queries in parallel, you must launch Julia with multi-threading support (by e.g., setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable).

## Installation

Install DuckDB as follows:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DuckDB")
```

Alternatively, enter the package manager using the `]` key, and issue the following command:

```julia
pkg> add DuckDB
```

## Basics

```julia
using DuckDB

# create a new in-memory database
con = DBInterface.connect(DuckDB.DB, ":memory:")

# create a table
DBInterface.execute(con, "CREATE TABLE integers (i INTEGER)")

# insert data by executing a prepared statement
stmt = DBInterface.prepare(con, "INSERT INTO integers VALUES(?)")
DBInterface.execute(stmt, [42])

# query the database
results = DBInterface.execute(con, "SELECT 42 a")
print(results)
```

Some SQL statements, such as PIVOT and IMPORT DATABASE are executed as multiple prepared statements and will error when using `DuckDB.execute()`. Instead they can be run with `DuckDB.query()` instead of `DuckDB.execute()` and will always return a materialized result.

## Scanning DataFrames

The DuckDB Julia package also provides support for querying Julia DataFrames. Note that the DataFrames are directly read by DuckDB - they are not inserted or copied into the database itself.

If you wish to load data from a DataFrame into a DuckDB table you can run a `CREATE TABLE ... AS` or `INSERT INTO` query.

```julia
using DuckDB
using DataFrames

# create a new in-memory dabase
con = DBInterface.connect(DuckDB.DB)

# create a DataFrame
df = DataFrame(a = [1, 2, 3], b = [42, 84, 42])

# register it as a view in the database
DuckDB.register_data_frame(con, df, "my_df")

# run a SQL query over the DataFrame
results = DBInterface.execute(con, "SELECT * FROM my_df")
print(results)
```

## Appender API

The DuckDB Julia package also supports the [Appender API]({% link docs/archive/1.1/data/appender.md %}), which is much faster than using prepared statements or individual `INSERT INTO` statements. Appends are made in row-wise format. For every column, an `append()` call should be made, after which the row should be finished by calling `flush()`. After all rows have been appended, `close()` should be used to finalize the Appender and clean up the resulting memory.

```julia
using DuckDB, DataFrames, Dates
db = DuckDB.DB()
# create a table
DBInterface.execute(db,
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE data(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value FLOAT, timestamp TIMESTAMP, date DATE)")
# create data to insert
len = 100
df = DataFrames.DataFrame(
        id = collect(1:len),
        value = rand(len),
        timestamp = Dates.now() + Dates.Second.(1:len),
        date = Dates.today() + Dates.Day.(1:len)
    )
# append data by row
appender = DuckDB.Appender(db, "data")
for i in eachrow(df)
    for j in i
        DuckDB.append(appender, j)
    end
    DuckDB.end_row(appender)
end
# close the appender after all rows
DuckDB.close(appender)
```

## Concurrency

Within a Julia process, tasks are able to concurrently read and write to the database, as long as each task maintains its own connection to the database. In the example below, a single task is spawned to periodically read the database and many tasks are spawned to write to the database using both [`INSERT` statements]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/statements/insert.md %}) as well as the [Appender API]({% link docs/archive/1.1/data/appender.md %}).

```julia
using Dates, DataFrames, DuckDB
db = DuckDB.DB()
DBInterface.connect(db)
DBInterface.execute(db, "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE data (date TIMESTAMP, id INTEGER)")

function run_reader(db)
    # create a DuckDB connection specifically for this task
    conn = DBInterface.connect(db)
    while true
        println(DBInterface.execute(conn,
                "SELECT id, count(date) AS count, max(date) AS max_date
                FROM data GROUP BY id ORDER BY id") |> DataFrames.DataFrame)
        Threads.sleep(1)
    end
    DBInterface.close(conn)
end
# spawn one reader task
Threads.@spawn run_reader(db)

function run_inserter(db, id)
    # create a DuckDB connection specifically for this task
    conn = DBInterface.connect(db)
    for i in 1:1000
        Threads.sleep(0.01)
        DuckDB.execute(conn, "INSERT INTO data VALUES (current_timestamp, ?)"; id);
    end
    DBInterface.close(conn)
end
# spawn many insert tasks
for i in 1:100
    Threads.@spawn run_inserter(db, 1)
end

function run_appender(db, id)
    # create a DuckDB connection specifically for this task
    appender = DuckDB.Appender(db, "data")
    for i in 1:1000
        Threads.sleep(0.01)
        row = (Dates.now(Dates.UTC), id)
        for j in row
            DuckDB.append(appender, j);
        end
        DuckDB.end_row(appender);
    end
    DuckDB.close(appender);
end
# spawn many appender tasks
for i in 1:100
    Threads.@spawn run_appender(db, 2)
end
```
