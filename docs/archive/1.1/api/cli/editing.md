> The linenoise-based CLI editor is currently only available for macOS and Linux.

DuckDB's CLI uses a line-editing library based on [linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise), which has shortcuts that are based on [Emacs mode of readline](https://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html). Below is a list of available commands.

## Using Read-Line

If you prefer, you can use [`rlwrap`](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) to use read-line directly with the shell. Then, use `Shift`+`Enter` to insert a newline and `Enter` to execute the query:

```bash
rlwrap --substitute-prompt="D " duckdb -batch
```
