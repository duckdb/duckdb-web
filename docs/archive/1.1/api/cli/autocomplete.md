The shell offers context-aware autocomplete of SQL queries through the [`autocomplete` extension]({% link docs/archive/1.1/extensions/autocomplete.md %}). autocomplete is triggered by pressing `Tab`.

Multiple autocomplete suggestions can be present. You can cycle forwards through the suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab`, or `Shift+Tab` to cycle backwards. autocompletion can be reverted by pressing `ESC` twice.

The shell autocompletes four different groups:

* Keywords
* Table names and table functions
* Column names and scalar functions
* File names

The shell looks at the position in the SQL statement to determine which of these autocompletions to trigger. For example:

```sql
SELECT s
```

```text
student_id
```

```sql
SELECT student_id F
```

```text
FROM
```

```sql
SELECT student_id FROM g
```

```text
grades
```

```sql
SELECT student_id FROM 'd
```

```text
'data/
```

```sql
SELECT student_id FROM 'data/
```

```text
'data/grades.csv
```
