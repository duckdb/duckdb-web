title: S3 Parquet Export

To write a Parquet file to S3, the [`httpfs` extension]({% link docs/archive/1.1/extensions/httpfs/overview.md %}) is required. This can be installed using the `INSTALL` SQL command. This only needs to be run once.

```sql
INSTALL httpfs;
```

To load the `httpfs` extension for usage, use the `LOAD` SQL command:

```sql
LOAD httpfs;
```

After loading the `httpfs` extension, set up the credentials to write data. Note that the `region` parameter should match the region of the bucket you want to access.

```sql
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE S3,
    KEY_ID 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
    SECRET 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',
    REGION 'us-east-1'
);
```

> Tip If you get an IO Error (`Connection error for HTTP HEAD`), configure the endpoint explicitly via `ENDPOINT 's3.⟨your-region⟩.amazonaws.com'`.

Alternatively, use the [`aws` extension]({% link docs/archive/1.1/extensions/aws.md %}) to retrieve the credentials automatically:

```sql
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE S3,
    PROVIDER CREDENTIAL_CHAIN
);
```

After the `httpfs` extension is set up and the S3 credentials are correctly configured, Parquet files can be written to S3 using the following command:

```sql
COPY ⟨table_name⟩ TO 's3://bucket/file.parquet';
```

Similarly, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is supported through the Interoperability API. You need to create [HMAC keys](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings;tab=interoperability) and provide the credentials as follows:

```sql
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE GCS,
    KEY_ID 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
    SECRET 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
);
```

After setting up the GCS credentials, you can export using:

```sql
COPY ⟨table_name⟩ TO 'gs://gcs_bucket/file.parquet';
```
