title: Spatial Extension
---

The `spatial` extension provides support for geospatial data processing in DuckDB.
For an overview of the extension, see our [blog post]({% post_url 2023-04-28-spatial %}).

## Installing and Loading

To install and load the `spatial` extension, run:

```sql
INSTALL spatial;
LOAD spatial;
```

## The `GEOMETRY` Type

The core of the spatial extension is the `GEOMETRY` type. If you're unfamiliar with geospatial data and GIS tooling, this type probably works very different from what you'd expect.

On the surface, the `GEOMETRY` type is a binary representation of “geometry” data made up out of sets of vertices (pairs of X and Y `double` precision floats). But what makes it somewhat special is that its actually used to store one of several different geometry subtypes. These are `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, as well as their “collection” equivalents, `MULTIPOINT`, `MULTILINESTRING` and `MULTIPOLYGON`. Lastly there is `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`, which can contain any of the other subtypes, as well as other `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`s recursively.

This may seem strange at first, since DuckDB already have types like `LIST`, `STRUCT` and `UNION` which could be used in a similar way, but the design and behavior of the `GEOMETRY` type is actually based on the [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) geometry model, which is a standard used by many other databases and GIS software.

The spatial extension also includes a couple of experimental non-standard explicit geometry types, such as `POINT_2D`, `LINESTRING_2D`, `POLYGON_2D` and `BOX_2D` that are based on DuckDBs native nested types, such as `STRUCT` and `LIST`. Since these have a fixed and predictable internal memory layout, it is theoretically possible to optimize a lot of geospatial algorithms to be much faster when operating on these types than on the `GEOMETRY` type. However, only a couple of functions in the spatial extension have been explicitly specialized for these types so far. All of these new types are implicitly castable to `GEOMETRY`, but with a small conversion cost, so the `GEOMETRY` type is still the recommended type to use for now if you are planning to work with a lot of different spatial functions.

`GEOMETRY` is not currently capable of storing additional geometry types such as curved geometries or triangle networks. Additionally, the `GEOMETRY` type does not store SRID information on a per value basis. These limitations may be addressed in the future.
