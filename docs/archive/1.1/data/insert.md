title: INSERT Statements
---

`INSERT` statements are the standard way of loading data into a relational database. When using `INSERT` statements, the values are supplied row-by-row. While simple, there is significant overhead involved in parsing and processing individual `INSERT` statements. This makes lots of individual row-by-row insertions very inefficient for bulk insertion.

> Bestpractice As a rule-of-thumb, avoid using lots of individual row-by-row `INSERT` statements when inserting more than a few rows (i.e., avoid using `INSERT` statements as part of a loop). When bulk inserting data, try to maximize the amount of data that is inserted per statement.

If you must use `INSERT` statements to load data in a loop, avoid executing the statements in auto-commit mode. After every commit, the database is required to sync the changes made to disk to ensure no data is lost. In auto-commit mode every single statement will be wrapped in a separate transaction, meaning `fsync` will be called for every statement. This is typically unnecessary when bulk loading and will significantly slow down your program.

> Tip If you absolutely must use `INSERT` statements in a loop to load data, wrap them in calls to `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT`.

## Syntax

An example of using `INSERT INTO` to load data in a table is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO people VALUES (1, 'Mark'), (2, 'Hannes');
```
