title: CSV Import Tips
---

Below is a collection of tips to help when attempting to import complex CSV files. In the examples, we use the [`flights.csv`](/data/flights.csv) file.

## Override the Header Flag if the Header Is Not Correctly Detected

If a file contains only string columns the `header` auto-detection might fail. Provide the `header` option to override this behavior.

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('flights.csv', header = true);
```

## Provide Names if the File Does Not Contain a Header

If the file does not contain a header, names will be auto-generated by default. You can provide your own names with the `names` option.

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('flights.csv', names = ['DateOfFlight', 'CarrierName']);
```

## Override the Types of Specific Columns

The `types` flag can be used to override types of only certain columns by providing a struct of `name` â†’ `type` mappings.

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('flights.csv', types = {'FlightDate': 'DATE'});
```

## Use `COPY` When Loading Data into a Table

The [`COPY` statement]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/statements/copy.md %}) copies data directly into a table. The CSV reader uses the schema of the table instead of auto-detecting types from the file. This speeds up the auto-detection, and prevents mistakes from being made during auto-detection.

```sql
COPY tbl FROM 'test.csv';
```

## Use `union_by_name` When Loading Files with Different Schemas

The `union_by_name` option can be used to unify the schema of files that have different or missing columns. For files that do not have certain columns, `NULL` values are filled in.

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('flights*.csv', union_by_name = true);
```
