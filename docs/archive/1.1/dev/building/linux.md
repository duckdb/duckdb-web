## Prerequisites

On Linux, install the required packages with the package manager of your distribution.

### Ubuntu and Debian

```batch
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git g++ cmake ninja-build libssl-dev
```

### Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat

```batch
sudo yum install -y git g++ cmake ninja-build openssl-devel
```

### Alpine Linux

```batch
apk add g++ git make cmake ninja
```

Note that Alpine Linux uses the musl libc as its C standard library.
There are no official binaries distributed for musl libc but DuckDB can be build with it manually following the instructions on this page.

## Building DuckDB

Clone and build DuckDB as follows:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb
cd duckdb
GEN=ninja make
```

Once the build finishes successfully, you can find the `duckdb` binary in the `build` directory:

```batch
build/release/duckdb
```

For different build configurations (`debug`, `relassert`, etc.), please consult the [Build Configurations page]({% link docs/archive/1.1/dev/building/build_configuration.md %}).

### Building Using Extension Flags

To build using extension flags, set the `CORE_EXTENSIONS` flag to the list of extensions that you want to be build. For example:

```batch
CORE_EXTENSIONS='autocomplete;httpfs;icu;json;tpch' GEN=ninja make
```

## Troubleshooting

### R Package on Linux AArch64: `too many GOT entries` Build Error

**Problem:**
Building the R package on Linux running on an ARM64 architecture (AArch64) may result in the following error message:

```console
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/include/c++/10/bits/basic_string.tcc:206:
warning: too many GOT entries for -fpic, please recompile with -fPIC
```

**Solution:**
Create or edit the `~/.R/Makevars` file. This example also contains the [flag to parallelize the build](#r-package-the-build-only-uses-a-single-thread):

```ini
ALL_CXXFLAGS = $(PKG_CXXFLAGS) -fPIC $(SHLIB_CXXFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS)
MAKEFLAGS = -j$(nproc)
```

When making this change, also consider [making the build parallel](#r-package-the-build-only-uses-a-single-thread).

### Building the httpfs Extension Fails

**Problem:**
When building the [`httpfs` extension]({% link docs/archive/1.1/extensions/httpfs/overview.md %}) on Linux, the build may fail with the following error.

```console
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:230 (message):
  Could NOT find OpenSSL, try to set the path to OpenSSL root folder in the
  system variable OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR (missing: OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY
  OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR)
```

**Solution:**
Install the `libssl-dev` library.

```batch
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev
```

Then, build with:

```batch
GEN=ninja CORE_EXTENSIONS="httpfs" make
```
