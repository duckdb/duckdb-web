We designed DuckDB to be easy to deploy and operate. We believe that most users do not need to consult the pages of the operations manual.
However, there are certain setups – e.g., when DuckDB is running in mission-critical infrastructure – where we would like to offer advice on how to configure DuckDB.
The operations manual contains advice for these cases and also offers convenient configuration snippets such as Gitignore files.

For advice on getting the best performance from DuckDB, see also the [Performance Guide]({% link docs/archive/1.1/guides/performance/overview.md %}).
