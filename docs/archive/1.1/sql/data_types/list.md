title: List Type
---

A `LIST` column encodes lists of values. Fields in the column can have values with different lengths, but they must all have the same underlying type. `LIST`s are typically used to store arrays of numbers, but can contain any uniform data type, including other `LIST`s and `STRUCT`s.

`LIST`s are similar to PostgreSQL's `ARRAY` type. DuckDB uses the `LIST` terminology, but some [`array_` functions]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/functions/list.md %}) are provided for PostgreSQL compatibility.

See the [data types overview]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/data_types/overview.md %}) for a comparison between nested data types.

> For storing fixed-length lists, DuckDB uses the [`ARRAY` type]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/data_types/array.md %}).

## Creating Lists

Lists can be created using the [`list_value(expr, ...)`]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/functions/list.md %}#list_valueany-) function or the equivalent bracket notation `[expr, ...]`. The expressions can be constants or arbitrary expressions. To create a list from a table column, use the [`list`]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/functions/aggregates.md %}#general-aggregate-functions) aggregate function.

List of integers:

```sql
SELECT [1, 2, 3];
```

List of strings with a `NULL` value:

```sql
SELECT ['duck', 'goose', NULL, 'heron'];
```

List of lists with `NULL` values:

```sql
SELECT [['duck', 'goose', 'heron'], NULL, ['frog', 'toad'], []];
```

Create a list with the list_value function:

```sql
SELECT list_value(1, 2, 3);
```

Create a table with an `INTEGER` list column and a `VARCHAR` list column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE list_table (int_list INTEGER[], varchar_list VARCHAR[]);
```

## Retrieving from Lists

Retrieving one or more values from a list can be accomplished using brackets and slicing notation, or through [list functions]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/functions/list.md %}) like `list_extract`. Multiple equivalent functions are provided as aliases for compatibility with systems that refer to lists as arrays. For example, the function `array_slice`.

> We wrap the list creation in parenthesis so that it happens first.
> This is only needed in our basic examples here, not when working with a list column.
> For example, this can't be parsed: `SELECT ['a', 'b', 'c'][1]`.

<div class="monospace_table"></div>

| Example                                  | Result     |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------|
| SELECT (['a', 'b', 'c'])[3]              | 'c'        |
| SELECT (['a', 'b', 'c'])[-1]             | 'c'        |
| SELECT (['a', 'b', 'c'])[2 + 1]          | 'c'        |
| SELECT list_extract(['a', 'b', 'c'], 3)  | 'c'        |
| SELECT (['a', 'b', 'c'])[1:2]            | ['a', 'b'] |
| SELECT (['a', 'b', 'c'])[:2]             | ['a', 'b'] |
| SELECT (['a', 'b', 'c'])[-2:]            | ['b', 'c'] |
| SELECT list_slice(['a', 'b', 'c'], 2, 3) | ['b', 'c'] |

## Comparison and Ordering

The `LIST` type can be compared using all the [comparison operators]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/expressions/comparison_operators.md %}).
These comparisons can be used in [logical expressions]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/expressions/logical_operators.md %})
such as `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses, and return [`BOOLEAN` values]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/data_types/boolean.md %}).

The `LIST` ordering is defined positionally using the following rules, where `min_len = min(len(l1), len(l2))`.

* **Equality.** `l1` and `l2` are equal, if for each `i` in `[1, min_len]`: `l1[i] = l2[i]`.
* **Less Than**. For the first index `i` in `[1, min_len]` where `l1[i] != l2[i]`:
  If `l1[i] < l2[i]`, `l1` is less than `l2`.

`NULL` values are compared following PostgreSQL's semantics.
Lower nesting levels are used for tie-breaking.

Here are some queries returning `true` for the comparison.

```sql
SELECT [1, 2] < [1, 3] AS result;
```

```sql
SELECT [[1], [2, 4, 5]] < [[2]] AS result;
```

```sql
SELECT [ ] < [1] AS result;
```

These queries return `false`.

```sql
SELECT [ ] < [ ] AS result;
```

```sql
SELECT [1, 2] < [1] AS result;
```

These queries return `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT [1, 2] < [1, NULL, 4] AS result;
```

## Updating Lists

Updates on lists are internally represented as an insert and a delete operation.
Therefore, updating list values may lead to a duplicate key error on primary/unique keys.
See the following example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, lst INTEGER[], comment VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (1, [12, 34], 'asd');
UPDATE tbl SET lst = [56, 78] WHERE id = 1;
```

```console
Constraint Error: Duplicate key "id: 1" violates primary key constraint.
If this is an unexpected constraint violation please double check with the known index limitations section in our documentation (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/indexes).
```
