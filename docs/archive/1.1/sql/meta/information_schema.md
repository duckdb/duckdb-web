The views in the `information_schema` are SQL-standard views that describe the catalog entries of the database. These views can be filtered to obtain information about a specific column or table.
DuckDB's implementation is based on [PostgreSQL's information schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/infoschema-columns.html).

## Tables

### `character_sets`: Character Sets

| Column | Description | Type | Example |
|--------|-------------|------|---------|
| `character_set_catalog` | Currently not implemented – always `NULL`. | `VARCHAR` | `NULL` |
| `character_set_schema` | Currently not implemented – always `NULL`. | `VARCHAR` | `NULL` |
| `character_set_name` | Name of the character set, currently implemented as showing the name of the database encoding. | `VARCHAR` | `'UTF8'` |
| `character_repertoire` | Character repertoire, showing `UCS` if the encoding is `UTF8`, else just the encoding name. | `VARCHAR` | `'UCS'` |
| `form_of_use` | Character encoding form, same as the database encoding. | `VARCHAR` | `'UTF8'` |
| `default_collate_catalog`| Name of the database containing the default collation (always the current database). | `VARCHAR` | `'my_db'` |
| `default_collate_schema` | Name of the schema containing the default collation. | `VARCHAR` | `'pg_catalog'` |
| `default_collate_name` | Name of the default collation. | `VARCHAR` | `'ucs_basic'` |

### `columns`: Columns

The view that describes the catalog information for columns is `information_schema.columns`. It lists the column present in the database and has the following layout:

| Column | Description | Type | Example |
|:--|:---|:-|:-|
| `table_catalog` | Name of the database containing the table (always the current database). | `VARCHAR` | `'my_db'` |
| `table_schema` | Name of the schema containing the table. | `VARCHAR` | `'main'` |
| `table_name` | Name of the table. | `VARCHAR` | `'widgets'` |
| `column_name` | Name of the column. | `VARCHAR` | `'price'` |
| `ordinal_position` | Ordinal position of the column within the table (count starts at 1). | `INTEGER` | `5` |
| `column_default` | Default expression of the column. |`VARCHAR`| `1.99` |
| `is_nullable` | `YES` if the column is possibly nullable, `NO` if it is known not nullable. |`VARCHAR`| `'YES'` |
| `data_type` | Data type of the column. |`VARCHAR`| `'DECIMAL(18, 2)'` |
| `character_maximum_length` | If `data_type` identifies a character or bit string type, the declared maximum length; `NULL` for all other data types or if no maximum length was declared. |`INTEGER`| `255` |
| `character_octet_length` | If `data_type` identifies a character type, the maximum possible length in octets (bytes) of a datum; `NULL` for all other data types. The maximum octet length depends on the declared character maximum length (see above) and the character encoding. |`INTEGER`| `1073741824` |
| `numeric_precision` | If `data_type` identifies a numeric type, this column contains the (declared or implicit) precision of the type for this column. The precision indicates the number of significant digits. For all other data types, this column is `NULL`. |`INTEGER`| `18` |
| `numeric_scale` | If `data_type` identifies a numeric type, this column contains the (declared or implicit) scale of the type for this column. The precision indicates the number of significant digits. For all other data types, this column is `NULL`. |`INTEGER`| `2` |
| `datetime_precision` | If `data_type` identifies a date, time, timestamp, or interval type, this column contains the (declared or implicit) fractional seconds precision of the type for this column, that is, the number of decimal digits maintained following the decimal point in the seconds value. No fractional seconds are currently supported in DuckDB. For all other data types, this column is `NULL`. |`INTEGER`| `0` |

### `constraint_column_usage`: Constraint Column Usage

This view describes all columns in the current database that are used by some constraint. For a check constraint, this view identifies the columns that are used in the check expression. For a not-null constraint, this view identifies the column that the constraint is defined on. For a foreign key constraint, this view identifies the columns that the foreign key references. For a unique or primary key constraint, this view identifies the constrained columns.
