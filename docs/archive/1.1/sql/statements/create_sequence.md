title: CREATE SEQUENCE Statement
---

The `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement creates a new sequence number generator.

### Examples

Generate an ascending sequence starting from 1:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial;
```

Generate sequence from a given start number:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START 101;
```

Generate odd numbers using `INCREMENT BY`:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 2;
```

Generate a descending sequence starting from 99:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START WITH 99 INCREMENT BY -1 MAXVALUE 99;
```

By default, cycles are not allowed and will result in error, e.g.:

```console
Sequence Error: nextval: reached maximum value of sequence "serial" (10)
```

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START WITH 1 MAXVALUE 10;
```

`CYCLE` allows cycling through the same sequence repeatedly:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START WITH 1 MAXVALUE 10 CYCLE;
```

### Creating and Dropping Sequences

Sequences can be created and dropped similarly to other catalogue items.

Overwrite an existing sequence:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SEQUENCE serial;
```

Only create sequence if no such sequence exists yet:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS serial;
```

Remove sequence:

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE serial;
```

Remove sequence if exists:

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS serial;
```

### Using Sequences for Primary Keys

Sequences can provide an integer primary key for a table. For example:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE id_sequence START 1;
CREATE TABLE tbl (id INTEGER DEFAULT nextval('id_sequence'), s VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO tbl (s) VALUES ('hello'), ('world');
SELECT * FROM tbl;
```

The script results in the following table:

| id |   s   |
|---:|-------|
| 1  | hello |
| 2  | world |

Sequences can also be added using the [`ALTER TABLE` statement]({% link docs/archive/1.1/sql/statements/alter_table.md %}). The following example adds an `id` column and fills it with values generated by the sequence:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (s VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES ('hello'), ('world');
CREATE SEQUENCE id_sequence START 1;
ALTER TABLE tbl ADD COLUMN id INTEGER DEFAULT nextval('id_sequence');
SELECT * FROM tbl;
```

This script results in the same table as the previous example.

### Selecting the Next Value

To select the next number from a sequence, use `nextval`:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START 1;
SELECT nextval('serial') AS nextval;
```

| nextval |
|--------:|
| 1       |

Using this sequence in an `INSERT` command:

```sql
INSERT INTO distributors VALUES (nextval('serial'), 'nothing');
```

### Selecting the Current Value

You may also view the current number from the sequence. Note that the `nextval` function must have already been called before calling `currval`, otherwise a Serialization Error (`sequence is not yet defined in this session`) will be thrown.

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START 1;
SELECT nextval('serial') AS nextval;
SELECT currval('serial') AS currval;
```

| currval |
|--------:|
| 1       |

### Syntax

<div id="rrdiagram"></div>

`CREATE SEQUENCE` creates a new sequence number generator.

If a schema name is given then the sequence is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. Temporary sequences exist in a special schema, so a schema name may not be given when creating a temporary sequence. The sequence name must be distinct from the name of any other sequence in the same schema.

After a sequence is created, you use the function `nextval` to operate on the sequence.

## Parameters

| Name | Description |
|:--|:-----|
| `CYCLE` or `NO CYCLE` | The `CYCLE` option allows the sequence to wrap around when the `maxvalue` or `minvalue` has been reached by an ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is reached, the next number generated will be the `minvalue` or `maxvalue`, respectively. If `NO CYCLE` is specified, any calls to `nextval` after the sequence has reached its maximum value will return an error. If neither `CYCLE` or `NO CYCLE` are specified, `NO CYCLE` is the default. |
| `increment` | The optional clause `INCREMENT BY increment` specifies which value is added to the current sequence value to create a new value. A positive value will make an ascending sequence, a negative one a descending sequence. The default value is 1. |
| `maxvalue` | The optional clause `MAXVALUE maxvalue` determines the maximum value for the sequence. If this clause is not supplied or `NO MAXVALUE` is specified, then default values will be used. The defaults are 2^63 - 1 and -1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively. |
| `minvalue` | The optional clause `MINVALUE minvalue` determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. If this clause is not supplied or `NO MINVALUE` is specified, then defaults will be used. The defaults are 1 and -(2^63 - 1) for ascending and descending sequences, respectively. |
| `name` | The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the sequence to be created. |
| `start` | The optional clause `START WITH start` allows the sequence to begin anywhere. The default starting value is `minvalue` for ascending sequences and `maxvalue` for descending ones. |
| `TEMPORARY` or `TEMP` | If specified, the sequence object is created only for this session, and is automatically dropped on session exit. Existing permanent sequences with the same name are not visible (in this session) while the temporary sequence exists, unless they are referenced with schema-qualified names. |

> Sequences are based on `BIGINT` arithmetic, so the range cannot exceed the range of an eight-byte integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807).
