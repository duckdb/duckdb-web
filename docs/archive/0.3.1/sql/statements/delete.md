The `DELETE` statement removes rows from the table identified by the table-name.

### Examples
```sql
-- remove the rows matching the condition "i=2" from the database
DELETE FROM tbl WHERE i=2;
-- delete all rows in the table "tbl"
DELETE FROM tbl;
```

### Syntax
<div id="rrdiagram"></div>

The `DELETE` statement removes rows from the table identified by the table-name.

If the `WHERE` clause is not present, all records in the table are deleted. If a `WHERE` clause is supplied, then only those rows for which the `WHERE` clause results in true are deleted. Rows for which the expression is false or NULL are retained.

The `USING` clause allows deleting based on the content of other tables or subqueries.
