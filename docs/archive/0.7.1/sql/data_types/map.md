## Map Data Type

`MAP`s are similar to `STRUCT`s in that they are an ordered list of "entries" where a key maps to a value. However, `MAP`s do not need to have the same keys present on each row, and thus open additional use cases. `MAP`s are useful when the schema is unknown beforehand; their flexibility is a key differentiator.

`MAP`s must have a single type for all keys, and a single type for all values. Keys and values can be any type, and the type of the keys does not need to match the type of the values (Ex: a `MAP` of `INT`s to `VARCHAR`s). `MAP`s may not have duplicate keys. `MAP`s return an empty list if a key is not found rather than throwing an error as structs do.

In contrast, `STRUCT`s must have string keys, but each key may have a value of a different type. See the [data types overview](../../sql/data_types/overview) for a comparison between nested data types.

To construct a `MAP`, use the `map` function. Provide a list of keys as the first parameter, and a list of values for the second. Alternatively use the `map_from_entries` function.

### Creating Maps
```sql
-- A map with integer keys and varchar values. This returns {1=a, 5=e}
select map([1, 5], ['a', 'e']);
-- Alternatively use the map_from_entries function. This returns {1=a, 5=e}
select map_from_entries([(1, 'a'), (5, 'e')]);
-- A map with integer keys and numeric values. This returns {1=42.001, 5=-32.100} 
select map([1, 5], [42.001, -32.1]);
-- Keys and/or values can also be nested types.
-- This returns {[a, b]=[1.1, 2.2], [c, d]=[3.3, 4.4]}
select map([['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']], [[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]]);
-- Create a table with a map column that has integer keys and double values
CREATE TABLE map_table (map_col MAP(INT,DOUBLE));
```
### Retrieving from Maps
`MAP`s use bracket notation for retrieving values. Selecting from a `MAP` returns a `LIST` rather than an individual value, with an empty `LIST` meaning that the key was not found. 
```sql
-- Use bracket notation to retrieve a list containing the value at a key's location. This returns [42]
-- Note that the expression in bracket notation must match the type of the map's key
SELECT map([100, 5], [42, 43])[100];
-- To retrieve the underlying value, use list selection syntax to grab the first element.
-- This returns 42
SELECT map([100, 5], [42, 43])[100][1];
-- If the element is not in the map, an empty list will be returned. Returns []
-- Note that the expression in bracket notation must match the type of the map's key else an error is returned
SELECT map([100, 5], [42, 43])[123];
-- The element_at function can also be used to retrieve a map value. This returns [42]
SELECT element_at(map([100, 5], [42, 43]),100);
```

## Comparison Operators

Nested types can be compared using all the [comparison operators](../expressions/comparison_operators).
These comparisons can be used in [logical expressions](../expressions/logical_operators)
for both `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses, as well as for creating [Boolean values](./boolean).

The ordering is defined positionally in the same way that words can be ordered in a dictionary.
`NULL` values compare greater than all other values and are considered equal to each other.

At the top level, `NULL` nested values obey standard SQL `NULL` comparison rules:
comparing a `NULL` nested value to a non-`NULL` nested value produces a `NULL` result.
Comparing nested value _members_ , however, uses the internal nested value rules for `NULL`s,
and a `NULL` nested value member will compare above a non-`NULL` nested value member.
