## Installation
The DuckDB CLI (Command Line Interface) is a single, dependency free executable. It is precompiled for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Please see the [installation page](../installation/index) under the CLI tab, or download the version for your environment from the [DuckDB GitHub releases page](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/) (in the "Assets" section).

For pre-release versions, you may compile from source, or download the executable file that is produced from GitHub Actions:
* [Linux](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions?query=workflow%3ALinuxRelease+is%3Asuccess+branch%3Amaster)
* [Mac](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions?query=workflow%3AOSX+is%3Asuccess+branch%3Amaster)
* [Windows](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions?query=workflow%3AWindows+is%3Asuccess+branch%3Amaster++)

The DuckDB CLI is based on the SQLite command line shell, so CLI-client-specific functionality is similar to what is described in the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) (although DuckDB's SQL syntax follows PostgreSQL conventions).


## Getting Started
Once the CLI executable has been downloaded, unzip it and save it to any directory. Navigate to that directory in a terminal and enter the command `duckdb` to run the executable. If in a PowerShell or POSIX shell environment, use the command `./duckdb` instead. To see additional command line options to use when starting the CLI, use the command `duckdb --help`.
By default, the CLI will open a temporary in-memory database. To open or create a persistent database, simply include a path as a command line argument like `duckdb path/to/my_database.duckdb`. This path can point to an existing database or to a file that does not yet exist and DuckDB will open or create a database at that location as needed. The file may have any arbitrary extension, but `.db` or `.duckdb` are two common choices. You will see a prompt like the below, with a D on the final line.

```command
v0.3.4 662041e2b
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D
```

Once the CLI has been opened, enter a SQL statement followed by a semicolon, then hit enter and it will be executed. Results will be displayed in a table in the terminal. If a semicolon is omitted, hitting enter will allow for multi-line SQL statements to be entered.

```sql
D SELECT 'quack' AS my_column;
```

| my_column |
|-----------|
| quack     |

```sql
D SELECT
>     'nicely formatted quack' AS my_column,
>     'excited quacking' AS another_column;
```

|       my_column        |  another_column  |
|------------------------|------------------|
| nicely formatted quack | excited quacking |

The CLI supports all of DuckDB's rich SQL syntax including `SELECT`, `CREATE`, and `ALTER` statements, etc.

To exit the CLI, press Ctrl-D if your platform supports it. Otherwise press Ctrl-C. If using a persistent database, it will automatically checkpoint (save the latest edits to disk) and close. This will remove the .WAL file (the Write-Ahead-Log) and consolidate all of your data into the single file database.

## Special Commands (Dot Commands)
In addition to SQL syntax, special dot commands may be entered that are specific to the CLI client. To use one of these commands, begin the line with a period (`.`) immediately followed by the name of the command you wish to execute. Additional arguments to the command are entered, space separated, after the command. If an argument must contain a space, either single or double quotes may be used to wrap that parameter. Dot commands must be entered on a single line, and no whitespace may occur before the period. No semicolon is required at the end of the line. To see available commands, use the `.help` command:

Note that the above list of methods is extensive, and DuckDB supports only a subset of the commands that are displayed. Please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues) if a command that is central to your workflow is not yet supported.

As an example of passing an argument to a dot command, the `.help` text may be filtered by passing in a text string as the second argument.

```command
D .help sh
```
```command
.sha3sum ...             Compute a SHA3 hash of database content
.shell CMD ARGS...       Run CMD ARGS... in a system shell
.show                    Show the current values for various settings
```

## Configuring the CLI

The various options above can be used to configure the CLI. On start-up, the CLI reads and executes all commands in the file `~/.duckdbrc`. This allows you to store the configuration state of the CLI. For example, if you wish to change the `NULL` value display and the prompt, you may create the following `~/.duckdbrc` file.

```
.prompt 'D '
.null NULL
```

## Syntax Highlighting
By default the shell includes support for syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting can be disabled using the `.highlight off` command.

The colors of the syntax highlighting can also be configured using the following commands.

```
D .constant
Error: Expected usage: .constant [red|green|yellow|blue|magenta|cyan|white|brightblack|brightred|brightgreen|brightyellow|brightblue|brightmagenta|brightcyan|brightwhite]
D .keyword
Error: Expected usage: .keyword [red|green|yellow|blue|magenta|cyan|white|brightblack|brightred|brightgreen|brightyellow|brightblue|brightmagenta|brightcyan|brightwhite]
D .keywordcode
Error: Expected usage: .keywordcode [terminal_code]
D .constantcode
Error: Expected usage: .constantcode [terminal_code]
```

## Auto-Complete
The shell offers context-aware auto-complete of SQL queries. Auto-complete is triggered by pressing the tab character. The shell auto-completes four different groups: (1) keywords, (2) table names + table functions, (3) column names + scalar functions, and (4) file names. The shell looks at the position in the SQL statement to determine which of these auto-completions to trigger. For example:

```sql
S -> SELECT

SELECT s -> student_id

SELECT student_id F -> FROM


SELECT student_id FROM g -> grades

SELECT student_id FROM 'd -> data/

SELECT student_id FROM 'data/ -> data/grades.csv
```

## Output Formats
The `.mode` command may be used to change the appearance of the tables returned in the terminal output. In addition to customizing the appearance, these modes have additional benefits. This can be useful for presenting DuckDB output elsewhere by redirecting the terminal output to a file, for example (see "Writing Results to a File" section below). Using the `insert` mode will build a series of SQL statements that can be used to insert the data at a later point. The `markdown` mode is particularly useful for building documentation!

|    mode    |                  description                 |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ascii      | Columns/rows delimited by 0x1F and 0x1E      |
| box        | Tables using unicode box-drawing characters  |
| csv        | Comma-separated values                       |
| column     | Output in columns.  (See .width)             |
| duckbox    | Tables with extensive features               |
| html       | HTML `<table>` code                          |
| insert     | SQL insert statements for TABLE              |
| json       | Results in a JSON array                      |
| jsonlines  | Results in a NDJSON                          |
| latex      | LaTeX tabular environment code               |
| line       | One value per line                           |
| list       | Values delimited by "\|"                     |
| markdown   | Markdown table format                        |
| quote      | Escape answers as for SQL                    |
| table      | ASCII-art table                              |
| tabs       | Tab-separated values                         |
| tcl        | TCL list elements                            |
| trash      | No output                                    |

```sql
D .mode markdown
D SELECT 'quacking intensifies' AS incoming_ducks;
```
```
|    incoming_ducks    |
|----------------------|
| quacking intensifies |
```

The output appearance can also be adjusted with the `.separator` command. If using an export mode that relies on a separator (`csv` or `tabs` for example), the separator will be reset when the mode is changed. For example, `.mode csv` will set the separator to a comma (`,`). Using `.separator "|"` will then convert the output to be pipe separated.
```sql
D .mode csv
D SELECT 1 AS col_1, 2 AS col_2
> UNION ALL
> SELECT 10 AS col1, 20 AS col_2;
```
```
col_1,col_2
1,2
10,20
```
```sql
D .separator "|"
D SELECT 1 AS col_1, 2 AS col_2
> UNION ALL
> SELECT 10 AS col1, 20 AS col_2;
```
```
col_1|col_2
1|2
10|20
```

## Prepared Statements
The DuckDB CLI supports executing prepared statements in addition to normal `SELECT` statements. To create a prepared
statement, use the `PREPARE` statement
```sql
D PREPARE S1 AS SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column < $1 OR my_column > $2;
```
To run the prepared statement with parameters, use the `EXECUTE` statement
```sql
D EXECUTE S1(42, 101);
```

## Querying the Database Schema
All DuckDB clients support [querying the database schema with SQL](../sql/information_schema), but the CLI has additional dot commands that can make it easier to understand the contents of a database.
The `.tables` command will return a list of tables in the database. It has an optional argument that will filter the results according to a [`LIKE` pattern](../sql/functions/patternmatching#like).

```sql
D CREATE TABLE swimmers AS SELECT 'duck' as animal;
D CREATE TABLE fliers AS SELECT 'duck' as animal;
D CREATE TABLE walkers AS SELECT 'duck' as animal;
D .tables
```
```command
fliers    swimmers  walkers
```

For example, to filter to only tables that contain an "l", use the `LIKE` pattern `%l%`.
```sql
D .tables %l%
```
```command
fliers   walkers
```

The `.schema` command will show all of the SQL statements used to define the schema of the database.

```command
D .schema
```
```command
CREATE TABLE fliers(animal VARCHAR);;
CREATE TABLE swimmers(animal VARCHAR);;
CREATE TABLE walkers(animal VARCHAR);;
```

## Opening Database Files
In addition to connecting to a database when opening the CLI, a new database connection can be made by using the `.open` command. If no additional parameters are supplied, a new in-memory database connection is created. This database will not be persisted when the CLI connection is closed.

```command
D .open
```

The `.open` command optionally accepts several options, but the final parameter can be used to indicate a path to a persistent database (or where one should be created). The special string `:memory:` can also be used to open a temporary in-memory database.

```command
D .open persistent.duckdb
```

One important option accepted by `.open` is the `--readonly` flag. This disallows any editing of the database. To open in read only mode, the database must already exist. This also means that a new in-memory database can't be opened in read only mode since in-memory databases are created upon connection.

```command
D .open --readonly preexisting.duckdb
```

## Writing Results to a File

By default, the DuckDB CLI sends results to the terminal's standard output. However, this can be modified using either the `.output` or `.once` commands. Pass in the desired output file location as a parameter. The `.once` command will only output the next set of results and then revert to standard out, but `.output` will redirect all subsequent output to that file location. Note that each result will overwrite the entire file at that destination. To revert back to standard output, enter `.output` with no file parameter.

In this example, the output format is changed to markdown, the destination is identified as a markdown file, and then DuckDB will write the output of the SQL statement to that file. Output is then reverted to standard output using `.output` with no parameter.
```sql
D .mode markdown
D .output my_results.md
D SELECT 'taking flight' AS output_column;
D .output
D SELECT 'back to the terminal' as displayed_column;
```

The file my_results.md will then contain:
```command
| output_column |
|---------------|
| taking flight |
```

The terminal will then display:

|   displayed_column   |
|----------------------|
| back to the terminal |

A common output format is CSV, or comma separated values. DuckDB supports [SQL syntax to export data as CSV or Parquet](../sql/statements/copy#csv-export), but the CLI-specific commands may be used to write a CSV instead if desired.

```sql
D .mode csv
D .once my_output_file.csv
D SELECT 1 AS col_1, 2 AS col_2
> UNION ALL
> SELECT 10 AS col1, 20 AS col_2;
```

The file my_output_file.csv will then contain:
```
col_1,col_2
1,2
10,20
```
<!-- TODO: Document .output -e and -x -->

By passing special options (flags) to the `.once` command, query results can also be sent to a temporary file and automatically opened in the user's default program. Use either the `-e` flag for a text file (opened in the default text editor), or the `-x` flag for a csv file (opened in the default spreadsheet editor). This is useful for more detailed inspection of query results, especially if there is a relatively large result set. The `.excel` command is equivalent to `.once -x`.

```sql
D .once -e
D SELECT 'quack' AS hello;
```
The results then open in the default text file editor of the system, for example:

<img src="/images/cli_docs_output_to_text_editor.jpg" alt="cli_docs_output_to_text_editor" title="Output to text editor" style="width:293px;"/>

## Import Data from CSV
DuckDB supports [SQL syntax to directly query or import CSV files](../data/csv), but the CLI-specific commands may be used to import a CSV instead if desired. The `.import` command takes two arguments and also supports several options. The first argument is the path to the csv file, and the second is the name of the DuckDB table to create. Since DuckDB requires stricter typing than SQLite (upon which the DuckDB CLI is based), the destination table must be created before using the `.import` command. To automatically detect the schema and create a table from a CSV, see the [`read_csv_auto` examples in the import docs](../data/csv).

In this example, a CSV file is generated by changing to CSV mode and setting an output file location:
```sql
D .mode csv
D .output import_example.csv
D SELECT 1 AS col_1, 2 AS col_2 UNION ALL SELECT 10 AS col1, 20 AS col_2;
```
<!-- TODO: If automatic table creation is added, document it! -->

Now that the CSV has been written, a table can be created with the desired schema and the CSV can be imported. The output is reset to the terminal to avoid continuing to edit the output file specified above. The `--skip N` option is used to ignore the first row of data since it is a header row and the table has already been created with the correct column names.
```sql
D .mode csv
D .output
D create table test_table (col_1 int, col_2 int);
D .import import_example.csv test_table --skip 1
```

Note that the `.import` command utilizes the current `.mode` and `.separator` settings when identifying the structure of the data to import. The `--csv` option can be used to override that behavior.
```sql
D .import import_example.csv test_table --skip 1 --csv
```

## Reading SQL From a File
The DuckDB CLI can read both SQL commands and dot commands from an external file intead of the terminal using the `.read` command. This allows for a number of commands to be run in sequence and allows command sequences to be saved and reused.

The `.read` command requires only one argument: the path to the file containing the SQL and/or commands to execute. After running the commands in the file, control will revert back to the terminal. Output from the execution of that file is governed by the same `.output` and `.once` commands that have been discussed previously. This allows the output to be displayed back to the terminal, as in the first example below, or out to another file, as in the second example.

In this example, the file `select_example.sql` is located in the same directory as duckdb.exe and contains the following SQL statement:
```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM generate_series(5);
```
To execute it from the CLI, the `.read` command is used.
```command
D .read select_example.sql
```
The output below is returned to the terminal by default (but can be adjusted using the `.output` or `.once` commands):

| generate_series |
|-----------------|
| 0               |
| 1               |
| 2               |
| 3               |
| 4               |
| 5               |


Multiple commands, including both SQL and dot commands, can also be run in a single `.read` command. In this example, the file `write_markdown_to_file.sql` is located in the same directory as duckdb.exe and contains the following commands:
```sql
.mode markdown
.output series.md
SELECT
    *
FROM generate_series(5);
```

To execute it from the CLI, the `.read` command is used as before.
```command
D .read write_markdown_to_file.sql
```

In this case, no output is returned to the terminal. Instead, the file `series.md` is created (or replaced if it already existed) with the markdown-formatted results shown here:
```
| generate_series |
|-----------------|
| 0               |
| 1               |
| 2               |
| 3               |
| 4               |
| 5               |
```

<!-- The edit function does not appear to work -->

A file may also be read/processed before the CLI opens, via the `-init` switch:
```
$ ./duckdb -init select_example.sql
-- Loading resources from select_example.sql
| generate_series |
|-----------------|
| 0               |
| 1               |
| 2               |
| 3               |
| 4               |
| 5               |
v0.6.1-dev83 dfae126ebb
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
D
```

## Non-interactive usage

To read/process a file and exit immediately, pipe the file contents in to `duckdb`:
```
$ ./duckdb < select_example.sql
| generate_series |
|-----------------|
| 0               |
| 1               |
| 2               |
| 3               |
| 4               |
| 5               |
$

```

## Loading Extensions
The CLI does not use the SQLite shell's `.load` command. Instead, directly execute DuckDB's SQL `install` and `load` commands as you would other SQL statements. See the [Extension docs](../extensions/overview) for details.

```command
D install 'fts';
D load 'fts';
```

<!-- SQL parameters do not appear to work -->
