DuckDB has a number of extensions available for use. Not all of them are included by default in every distribution, but DuckDB has a mechanism that allows for remote installation.

## Remote installation

If a given extensions is not available with your distribution, you can do the following to make it available.

```sql
INSTALL 'fts';
LOAD 'fts';
```

If you are using the Python API client, you can install and load them with the `load_extension(name: str)` and `install_extension(name: str)` methods.

## Unsigned extensions

All verified extensions are signed, if you wish to load your own extensions or extensions from untrusted third-parties you'll need to enable the `allow_unsigned_extensions` flag.  
To load unsigned extensions using the CLI, you'll need to pass the `-unsigned` flag to it on startup.

## Listing extensions

You can check the list of core and installed extensions with the following query:
```sql
select * from duckdb_extensions();
```

## Downloading extensions directly from S3

Downloading an extension directly could be helpful when building a lambda or container that uses DuckDB.
DuckDB extensions are stored in public S3 buckets, but the directory structure of those buckets is not searchable. 
As a result, a direct URL to the file must be used. 
To directly download an extension file, use the following format:  

```
https://extensions.duckdb.org/v{release_version_number}/{platform_name}/{extension_name}.duckdb_extension.gz
```
For example:
```
https://extensions.duckdb.org/v0.7.0/windows_amd64/json.duckdb_extension.gz
```

The list of supported platforms may increase over time, but the current list of platforms includes:
* linux_amd64_gcc4
* linux_amd64
* linux_arm64
* osx_amd64
* osx_arm64
* windows_amd64

See above for a list of extension names and how to pull the latest list of extensions.


## Loading an extension from local storage
Extensions are stored in gzip format, so they must be unzipped prior to use. 
There are many methods to decompress gzip. Here is a Python example:

```python
import gzip
import shutil

with gzip.open('httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz','rb') as f_in:
   with open('httpfs.duckdb_extension', 'wb') as f_out:
     shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)
```

After unzipping, the install and load commands can be used with the path to the .duckdb_extension file. 
For example, if the file was unzipped into the same directory as where DuckDB is being executed:
```sql
install 'httpfs.duckdb_extension';
load 'httpfs.duckdb_extension';
```
