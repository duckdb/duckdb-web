# How to write a Parquet file directly to S3 or GCS

To write a Parquet file to S3, the `HTTPFS` extension is required. This can be installed use the `INSTALL` SQL command. This only needs to be run once.

```sql
INSTALL httpfs;
```

To load the `HTTPFS` extension for usage, use the `LOAD` SQL command:

```sql
LOAD httpfs;
```

After loading the `HTTPFS` extension, set up the credentials and S3 region to write data. You may either use an access key and secret, or a token.

```sql
SET s3_region='us-east-1';
SET s3_access_key_id='<AWS access key id>';
SET s3_secret_access_key='<AWS secret access key>';
```

The alternative is to use a token:

```sql
SET s3_region='us-east-1';
SET s3_session_token='<AWS session token>';
```

After the `HTTPFS` extension is set up and the S3 credentials are correctly configured, Parquet files can be written to S3 using the following command:

```sql
COPY <table_name> TO 's3://bucket/file.parquet';
```

Similarly, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is supported through the Interoperability API. You need to create [HMAC keys](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings;tab=interoperability) and declare them:

```sql
SET s3_endpoint='storage.googleapis.com';
SET s3_access_key_id='key_id';
SET s3_secret_access_key='access_key';
```

Please note you will need to use the `s3://` URL to write your files.

```sql
COPY <table_name> TO 's3://gcs_bucket/file.parquet';
```
