## General-Purpose Data Types

The table below shows all the built-in general-purpose data types. The alternatives listed in the aliases column can be used to refer to these types as well, however, note that the aliases are not part of the SQL standard and hence might not be accepted by other database engines.

Implicit and explicit typecasting is possible between numerous types, see the [Typecasting]({% link docs/preview/sql/data_types/typecasting.md %}) page for details.

## Nested / Composite Types

DuckDB supports five nested data types: `ARRAY`, `LIST`, `MAP`, `STRUCT` and `UNION`. Each supports different use cases and has a different structure.

| Name | Description | Rules when used in a column | Build from values | Define in DDL/CREATE |
|:-|:---|:---|:--|:--|
| [`ARRAY`]({% link docs/preview/sql/data_types/array.md %}) | An ordered, fixed-length sequence of data values of the same type. | Each row must have the same data type within each instance of the `ARRAY` and the same number of elements. | `[1, 2, 3]` | `INTEGER[3]` |
| [`LIST`]({% link docs/preview/sql/data_types/list.md %}) | An ordered sequence of data values of the same type. | Each row must have the same data type within each instance of the `LIST`, but can have any number of elements. | `[1, 2, 3]` | `INTEGER[]` |
| [`MAP`]({% link docs/preview/sql/data_types/map.md %}) | A dictionary of multiple named values, each key having the same type and each value having the same type. Keys and values can be any type and can be different types from one another. | Rows may have different keys. | `map([1, 2], ['a', 'b'])` | `MAP(INTEGER, VARCHAR)` |
| [`STRUCT`]({% link docs/preview/sql/data_types/struct.md %}) | A dictionary of multiple named values, where each key is a string, but the value can be a different type for each key. | Each row must have the same keys. | `{'i': 42, 'j': 'a'}` | `STRUCT(i INTEGER, j VARCHAR)` |
| [`UNION`]({% link docs/preview/sql/data_types/union.md %}) | A union of multiple alternative data types, storing one of them in each value at a time. A union also contains a discriminator “tag” value to inspect and access the currently set member type. | Rows may be set to different member types of the union. | `union_value(num := 2)` | `UNION(num INTEGER, text VARCHAR)` |

### Rules for Case Sensitivity

The keys of `MAP`s are case-sensitive, while keys of `UNION`s and `STRUCT`s are case-insensitive.
For examples, see the [Rules for Case Sensitivity section]({% link docs/preview/sql/dialect/overview.md %}#case-sensitivity-of-keys-in-nested-data-structures).

### Updating Values of Nested Types

When performing _updates_ on values of nested types, DuckDB performs a _delete_ operation followed by an _insert_ operation.
When used in a table with ART indexes (either via explicit indexes or primary keys/unique constraints), this can lead to [unexpected constraint violations]({% link docs/preview/sql/indexes.md %}#constraint-checking-in-update-statements).

## Nesting

`ARRAY`, `LIST`, `MAP`, `STRUCT` and `UNION` types can be arbitrarily nested to any depth, so long as the type rules are observed.

Struct with `LIST`s:

```sql
SELECT {'birds': ['duck', 'goose', 'heron'], 'aliens': NULL, 'amphibians': ['frog', 'toad']};
```

Struct with list of `MAP`s:

```sql
SELECT {'test': [MAP([1, 5], [42.1, 45]), MAP([1, 5], [42.1, 45])]};
```

A list of `UNION`s:

```sql
SELECT [union_value(num := 2), union_value(str := 'ABC')::UNION(str VARCHAR, num INTEGER)];
```

## Performance Implications

The choice of data types can have a strong effect on performance. Please consult the [Performance Guide]({% link docs/preview/guides/performance/schema.md %}) for details.
