Casting refers to the operation of converting a value in a particular data type to the corresponding value in another data type.
Casting can occur either implicitly or explicitly.

## Explicit Casting

The standard SQL syntax for explicit casting is `CAST(expr AS TYPENAME)`, where `TYPENAME` is a name (or alias) of one of [DuckDB's data types](../data_types/overview). DuckDB also supports the shorthand `expr::TYPENAME`, which is also present in PostgreSQL.

```sql
SELECT CAST(i AS VARCHAR) FROM generate_series(1, 3) tbl(i);
-- "1", "2", "3"
```
```sql
SELECT i::DOUBLE FROM generate_series(1, 3) tbl(i);
-- 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
```
```sql
SELECT CAST('hello' AS INTEGER);
-- Conversion Error: Could not convert string 'hello' to INT32
```
```sql
SELECT TRY_CAST('hello' AS INTEGER);
-- NULL
```

The exact behavior of the cast depends on the source and destination types. For example, when casting from `VARCHAR` to any other type, the string will be attempted to be converted.

Not all casts are possible. For example, it is not possible to convert an `INTEGER` to a `DATE`. Casts may also throw errors when the cast could not be successfully performed. For example, trying to cast the string `'hello'` to an `INTEGER` will result in an error being thrown.

`TRY_CAST` can be used when the preferred behavior is not to throw an error, but instead to return a `NULL` value. `TRY_CAST` will never throw an error, and will instead return `NULL` if a cast is not possible.

## Implicit Casting

In many situations, the system will add casts by itself. This is called *implicit* casting. This happens for example when a function is called with an argument that does not match the type of the function, but can be casted to the desired type.

Consider the function `sin(DOUBLE)`. This function takes as input argument a column of type `DOUBLE`, however, it can be called with an integer as well: `sin(1)`. The integer is converted into a double before being passed to the `sin` function.

Generally, implicit casts only cast upwards. That is to say, we can implicitly cast an `INTEGER` to a `BIGINT`, but not the other way around.

> Deprecated Prior to version 0.10.0, DuckDB allowed any type to be implicitly cast to `VARCHAR` during function binding.
> Version 0.10.0 introduced a [breaking change which no longer allows implicit casts to `VARCHAR`](/2024/02/13/announcing-duckdb-0100#breaking-sql-changes).
> The [`old_implicit_casting` configuration option](../pragmas#implicit-casting-to-varchar) setting can be used to revert to the old behavior.
> However, please note that this flag will be deprecated in the future.

## Allowed Casting Operations

Values of a particular data type can typically not be casted to any arbitrary target data type. The supported cast operations are described in the [typecasting page](../data_types/typecasting) as part of the data types documentation.
