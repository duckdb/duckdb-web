blurb: The UNPIVOT statement allows columns to be stacked into rows that indicate the prior column name and value.
---

The `UNPIVOT` statement allows multiple columns to be stacked into fewer columns. 
In the basic case, multiple columns are stacked into two columns: a `NAME` column (which contains the name of the source column) and a `VALUE` column (which contains the value from the source column).

DuckDB implements both the SQL Standard `UNPIVOT` syntax and a simplified `UNPIVOT` syntax.
Both can utilize a [`columns` expression](/docs/sql/expressions/star#columns) to automatically detect the columns to unpivot. 
`PIVOT_LONGER` may also be used in place of the `UNPIVOT` keyword.

### Simplified UNPIVOT Syntax

The full syntax diagram is below, but the simplified `UNPIVOT` syntax can be summarized using spreadsheet pivot table naming conventions as:
```sql
UNPIVOT [dataset]
ON [column(s)]
INTO 
	NAME [name-column-name]
	VALUE [value-column-name(s)]
```


#### Example Data

All examples use the dataset produced by the queries below:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE monthly_sales(empid INT, dept TEXT, Jan INT, Feb INT, Mar INT, Apr INT, May INT, Jun INT);
INSERT INTO monthly_sales VALUES
(1, 'electronics', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
(2, 'clothes', 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60),
(3, 'cars', 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600);
```
```sql
FROM monthly_sales;
```

| empid |    dept     | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun |
|-------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1     | electronics | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| 2     | clothes     | 10  | 20  | 30  | 40  | 50  | 60  |
| 3     | cars        | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 |

<!-- 
    Easiest is to just unpivot all months into their own name/value pair manually. 
    Then show the columns-expr version. 
    Can also show the quarterly example. -->

#### UNPIVOT Manually
The most typical `UNPIVOT` transformation is to take already pivoted data and re-stack it into a column each for the name and value.
In this case, all months will be stacked into a `month` column and a `sales` column.

```sql
UNPIVOT monthly_sales
ON jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun
INTO
    NAME month
    VALUE sales;
```

| empid |    dept     | month | sales |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 1     | electronics | Jan   | 1     |
| 1     | electronics | Feb   | 2     |
| 1     | electronics | Mar   | 3     |
| 1     | electronics | Apr   | 4     |
| 1     | electronics | May   | 5     |
| 1     | electronics | Jun   | 6     |
| 2     | clothes     | Jan   | 10    |
| 2     | clothes     | Feb   | 20    |
| 2     | clothes     | Mar   | 30    |
| 2     | clothes     | Apr   | 40    |
| 2     | clothes     | May   | 50    |
| 2     | clothes     | Jun   | 60    |
| 3     | cars        | Jan   | 100   |
| 3     | cars        | Feb   | 200   |
| 3     | cars        | Mar   | 300   |
| 3     | cars        | Apr   | 400   |
| 3     | cars        | May   | 500   |
| 3     | cars        | Jun   | 600   |


#### UNPIVOT Dynamically using Columns Expression
In many cases, the number of columns to unpivot is not easy to predetermine ahead of time. 
In the case of this dataset, the query above would have to change each time a new month is added. 
The [`columns` expression](/docs/sql/expressions/star#columns) can be used to select all columns that are not `empid` or `dept`. 
This enables dynamic unpivoting that will work regardless of how many months are added.
The query below returns identical results to the one above.

```sql
UNPIVOT monthly_sales
ON COLUMNS(* EXCLUDE (empid, dept))
INTO
    NAME month
    VALUE sales;
```

| empid |    dept     | month | sales |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 1     | electronics | Jan   | 1     |
| 1     | electronics | Feb   | 2     |
| 1     | electronics | Mar   | 3     |
| 1     | electronics | Apr   | 4     |
| 1     | electronics | May   | 5     |
| 1     | electronics | Jun   | 6     |
| 2     | clothes     | Jan   | 10    |
| 2     | clothes     | Feb   | 20    |
| 2     | clothes     | Mar   | 30    |
| 2     | clothes     | Apr   | 40    |
| 2     | clothes     | May   | 50    |
| 2     | clothes     | Jun   | 60    |
| 3     | cars        | Jan   | 100   |
| 3     | cars        | Feb   | 200   |
| 3     | cars        | Mar   | 300   |
| 3     | cars        | Apr   | 400   |
| 3     | cars        | May   | 500   |
| 3     | cars        | Jun   | 600   |


#### UNPIVOT into multiple value columns
The `UNPIVOT` statement has additional flexibility: more than 2 destination columns are supported. 
This can be useful when the goal is to reduce the extent to which a dataset is pivoted, but not completely stack all pivoted columns.
To demonstrate this, the query below will generate a dataset with a separate column for the number of each month within the quarter (month 1, 2, or 3), and a separate row for each quarter. 
Since there are fewer quarters than months, this does make the dataset longer, but not as long as the above.


To accomplish this, multiple sets of columns are included in the `ON` clause. 
The `q1` and `q2` aliases are optional.
The number of columns in each set of columns in the `ON` clause must match the number of columns in the `VALUE` clause.
```sql
UNPIVOT monthly_sales 
    ON (jan, feb, mar) as q1, (apr, may, jun) as q2 
    INTO 
        NAME quarter 
        VALUE month_1_sales, month_2_sales, month_3_sales;
```

| empid |    dept     | quarter | month_1_sales | month_2_sales | month_3_sales |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1     | electronics | q1      | 1             | 2             | 3             |
| 1     | electronics | q2      | 4             | 5             | 6             |
| 2     | clothes     | q1      | 10            | 20            | 30            |
| 2     | clothes     | q2      | 40            | 50            | 60            |
| 3     | cars        | q1      | 100           | 200           | 300           |
| 3     | cars        | q2      | 400           | 500           | 600           |



#### Using UNPIVOT within a SELECT statement
The `UNPIVOT` statement may be included within a SELECT statement as a CTE ([a Common Table Expression, or WITH clause](../query_syntax/with)), or a subquery.
This allows for an `UNPIVOT` to be used alongside other SQL logic, as well as for multiple `UNPIVOT`s to be used in one query.

No `SELECT` is needed within the CTE, the `UNPIVOT` keyword can be thought of as taking its place.
```sql
WITH unpivot_alias AS (
    UNPIVOT monthly_sales
    ON COLUMNS(* EXCLUDE (empid, dept))
    INTO
        NAME month
        VALUE sales
) 
SELECT * FROM unpivot_alias;
```

An `UNPIVOT` may be used in a subquery and must be wrapped in parentheses. 
Note that this behavior is different than the SQL Standard Unpivot, as illustrated in subsequent examples.
```sql
SELECT 
    * 
FROM (
    UNPIVOT monthly_sales
    ON COLUMNS(* EXCLUDE (empid, dept))
    INTO
        NAME month
        VALUE sales
) unpivot_alias;
```

<!-- 
##### Multiple Unpivots 
(I didn't think this was quite as relevant, so I omitted it for brevity and since I didn't have a good example)
-->


#### Internals
Unpivoting is implemented entirely as rewrites into SQL queries. 
Each `UNPIVOT` is implemented as set of `UNNEST` functions, operating on a list of the column names and a list of the column values.
If dynamically unpivoting, the `COLUMNS` expression is evaluated first to calculate the column list.

For example:
```sql
UNPIVOT monthly_sales
ON jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun
INTO
    NAME month
    VALUE sales;
```

is translated into:
```sql
SELECT 
    empid,
    dept,
    UNNEST(['jan','feb','mar','apr','may','jun']) as "month",
    UNNEST(["jan","feb","mar","apr","may","jun"]) as "sales"
FROM monthly_sales;
```

Note the single quotes to build a list of text strings to populate `month`, and the double quotes to pull the column values for use in `sales`.
This produces the same result as the initial example:

| empid |    dept     | month | sales |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 1     | electronics | jan   | 1     |
| 1     | electronics | feb   | 2     |
| 1     | electronics | mar   | 3     |
| 1     | electronics | apr   | 4     |
| 1     | electronics | may   | 5     |
| 1     | electronics | jun   | 6     |
| 2     | clothes     | jan   | 10    |
| 2     | clothes     | feb   | 20    |
| 2     | clothes     | mar   | 30    |
| 2     | clothes     | apr   | 40    |
| 2     | clothes     | may   | 50    |
| 2     | clothes     | jun   | 60    |
| 3     | cars        | jan   | 100   |
| 3     | cars        | feb   | 200   |
| 3     | cars        | mar   | 300   |
| 3     | cars        | apr   | 400   |
| 3     | cars        | may   | 500   |
| 3     | cars        | jun   | 600   |




#### Simplified Unpivot Full Syntax Diagram
Below is the full syntax diagram of the `UNPIVOT` statement. 

<div id="rrdiagram"></div>


### SQL Standard Unpivot Syntax
The full syntax diagram is below, but the SQL Standard `UNPIVOT` syntax can be summarized as:
```sql
FROM [dataset]
UNPIVOT [INCLUDE NULLS] (
	[value-column-name(s)]
	FOR [name-column-name] IN [column(s)]
)
```

Note that only one column can be included in the `name-column-name` expression. 

#### SQL Standard Unpivot manually
To complete the basic `UNPIVOT` operation using the SQL standard syntax, only a few additions are needed.

```sql
FROM monthly_sales UNPIVOT (
    sales
    FOR month IN (jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun)
);
```

| empid |    dept     | month | sales |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 1     | electronics | Jan   | 1     |
| 1     | electronics | Feb   | 2     |
| 1     | electronics | Mar   | 3     |
| 1     | electronics | Apr   | 4     |
| 1     | electronics | May   | 5     |
| 1     | electronics | Jun   | 6     |
| 2     | clothes     | Jan   | 10    |
| 2     | clothes     | Feb   | 20    |
| 2     | clothes     | Mar   | 30    |
| 2     | clothes     | Apr   | 40    |
| 2     | clothes     | May   | 50    |
| 2     | clothes     | Jun   | 60    |
| 3     | cars        | Jan   | 100   |
| 3     | cars        | Feb   | 200   |
| 3     | cars        | Mar   | 300   |
| 3     | cars        | Apr   | 400   |
| 3     | cars        | May   | 500   |
| 3     | cars        | Jun   | 600   |

#### SQL Standard Unpivot Dynamically using Columns Expression
The [`columns` expression](/docs/sql/expressions/star#columns) can be used to determine the `IN` list of columns dynamically. 
This will continue to work even if additional `month` columns are added to the dataset. 
It produces the same result as the query above.

```sql
FROM monthly_sales UNPIVOT (
    sales
    FOR month IN (columns(* EXCLUDE (empid, dept)))
);
```

#### SQL Standard UNPIVOT into multiple value columns
The `UNPIVOT` statement has additional flexibility: more than 2 destination columns are supported. 
This can be useful when the goal is to reduce the extent to which a dataset is pivoted, but not completely stack all pivoted columns.
To demonstrate this, the query below will generate a dataset with a separate column for the number of each month within the quarter (month 1, 2, or 3), and a separate row for each quarter. 
Since there are fewer quarters than months, this does make the dataset longer, but not as long as the above.


To accomplish this, multiple columns are included in the `value-column-name` portion of the `UNPIVOT` statement.
Multiple sets of columns are included in the `IN` clause.
The `q1` and `q2` aliases are optional.
The number of columns in each set of columns in the `IN` clause must match the number of columns in the `value-column-name` portion.

```sql
FROM monthly_sales 
UNPIVOT (
    (month_1_sales, month_2_sales, month_3_sales)
    FOR quarter IN (
        (jan, feb, mar) as q1,
        (apr, may, jun) as q2
    )
);
```

| empid |    dept     | quarter | month_1_sales | month_2_sales | month_3_sales |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1     | electronics | q1      | 1             | 2             | 3             |
| 1     | electronics | q2      | 4             | 5             | 6             |
| 2     | clothes     | q1      | 10            | 20            | 30            |
| 2     | clothes     | q2      | 40            | 50            | 60            |
| 3     | cars        | q1      | 100           | 200           | 300           |
| 3     | cars        | q2      | 400           | 500           | 600           |
