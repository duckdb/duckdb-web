### Map Data Type

`MAP`s are similar to `STRUCT`s in that they are an ordered list of "entries" where a key maps to a value. However, `MAP`s do not need to have the same keys present for each row, and thus are suitable for other use cases. `MAP`s are useful when the schema is unknown beforehand or when the schema varies per row; their flexibility is a key differentiator.

`MAP`s must have a single type for all keys, and a single type for all values. Keys and values can be any type, and the type of the keys does not need to match the type of the values (Ex: a `MAP` of `VARCHAR` to `INT` is valid). `MAP`s may not have duplicate keys. `MAP`s return an empty list if a key is not found rather than throwing an error as structs do.

In contrast, `STRUCT`s must have string keys, but each key may have a value of a different type. See the [data types overview](../../sql/data_types/overview) for a comparison between nested data types.

To construct a `MAP`, use the bracket syntax preceded by the `MAP` keyword.

#### Creating Maps
```sql
-- A map with varchar keys and integer values. This returns {key1=1, key2=5}
select map { 'key1': 1, 'key2': 5 };
-- Alternatively use the map_from_entries function. This returns {key1=1, key2=5}
select map_from_entries([(key1, 1), (key2, 5)]);
-- A map with integer keys and numeric values. This returns {1=42.001, 5=-32.100} 
select map { 1: 42.001, 5: -32.1 };
-- Keys and/or values can also be nested types.
-- This returns {[a, b]=[1.1, 2.2], [c, d]=[3.3, 4.4]}
select map { ['a', 'b']: [1.1, 2.2], ['c', 'd']: [3.3, 4.4] };
-- Create a table with a map column that has integer keys and double values
CREATE TABLE map_table (map_col MAP(INT, DOUBLE));
```
#### Retrieving from Maps
`MAP`s use bracket notation for retrieving values. Selecting from a `MAP` returns a `LIST` rather than an individual value, with an empty `LIST` meaning that the key was not found. 
```sql
-- Use bracket notation to retrieve a list containing the value at a key's location. This returns [42]
-- Note that the expression in bracket notation must match the type of the map's key
SELECT map { 'key1': 5, 'key2': 43 }['key1'];
-- To retrieve the underlying value, use list selection syntax to grab the first element.
-- This returns 42
SELECT map { 'key1': 5, 'key2': 43 }['key1'][1];
-- If the element is not in the map, an empty list will be returned. Returns []
-- Note that the expression in bracket notation must match the type of the map's key else an error is returned
SELECT map { 'key1': 5, 'key2': 43 }['key3'];
-- The element_at function can also be used to retrieve a map value. This returns [42]
SELECT element_at(map { 'key1': 5, 'key2': 43 }, 'key1');
```

### Comparison Operators

Nested types can be compared using all the [comparison operators](../expressions/comparison_operators).
These comparisons can be used in [logical expressions](../expressions/logical_operators)
for both `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses, as well as for creating [Boolean values](./boolean).

The ordering is defined positionally in the same way that words can be ordered in a dictionary.
`NULL` values compare greater than all other values and are considered equal to each other.

At the top level, `NULL` nested values obey standard SQL `NULL` comparison rules:
comparing a `NULL` nested value to a non-`NULL` nested value produces a `NULL` result.
Comparing nested value _members_ , however, uses the internal nested value rules for `NULL`s,
and a `NULL` nested value member will compare above a non-`NULL` nested value member.
