You can browse the DuckDB documentation offline in two formats:

* As a [single-file PDF](/duckdb-docs.pdf) (approx. 4 MB)

* As a [website packaged in a single ZIP file](/duckdb-docs.zip) (approx. 40 MB). To browse the website locally, decompress the package, navigate to the `duckdb-docs` directory, and run:

  ```bash
  python -m http.server
  ```

    Then, connect to <http://localhost:8000/>.
