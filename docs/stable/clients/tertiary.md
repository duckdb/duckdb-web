## Support Tiers

There are three tiers of support for clients. [Primary clients and secondary clients]({% link docs/stable/clients/overview.md %}) are guaranteed to receive new features. For tertiary clients, there are no such guarantees as most are maintained by third-party contributors.

For the license of each client, please consult their repositories.
