## Prerequisites

Install Xcode and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then, install the required packages with:

```batch
brew install git cmake ninja
```

## Building DuckDB

Clone and build DuckDB as follows.

```batch
git clone https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb
cd duckdb
GEN=ninja make
```

Once the build finishes successfully, you can find the `duckdb` binary in the `build` directory:

```batch
build/release/duckdb
```

For different build configurations (`debug`, `relassert`, etc.), please consult the [Build Configurations page]({% link docs/stable/dev/building/build_configuration.md %}).

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failure: `'string' file not found`

**Problem:**
The build fails on macOS with following error:

```console

```

**Solution:**
Users report that reinstalling Xcode fixed their problem.
See related discussions on the [DuckDB GitHub issues](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14665#issuecomment-2452679953) and on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78999694/cant-compile-c-hello-world-with-clang-on-mac-sequoia-15-0-and-vs-code).

> Warning Attempting to reinstall your Xcode suite may impact other applications on your system. Proceed with caution.

```batch
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select --install
```

### Debug Build Prints malloc Warning

**Problem:**
The `debug` build on macOS prints a `malloc` warning, e.g.:

```text
duckdb(83082,0x205b30240) malloc: nano zone abandoned due to inability to reserve vm space.
```

**Solution:**
To prevent this, set the `MallocNanoZone` flag to 0:

```batch
MallocNanoZone=0 make debug
```

To apply this change for your future terminal sessions, you can add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```batch
export MallocNanoZone=0
```
