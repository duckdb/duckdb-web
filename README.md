This repository hosts the source code for the [DuckDB website](https://www.duckdb.org). Please file any questions or issues relating to the website or documentation here.

The DuckDB codebase is hosted in the [DuckDB repository](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb).

## Adding a new page

First, thank you for your contribution!

Each new page requires at least 2 edits:
* The creation of a new markdown page with the documentation. Please follow the format of another `.md` file in the `docs` folder.
* Add a link to the new page within `_data/menu_docs_dev.json`. This populates the dropdown menus.

The addition of a new guide requires one additional edit:
* Add a link to the new page within the Guides landing page: `docs/guides/index.md`

**Please test your changes using the steps listed in the [Building](#Building) section below.**

**When creating a PR, please check the box to "Allow edits from maintainers".**

Please enclose code in blocks that are tagged with the appropriate language. (Ex: \`\`\`sql CODE HERE \`\`\`). 

All examples should be self contained and reproducible if possible, meaning that any example tables are created as a part of the documentation.

Feedback is welcome on these contribution steps as well!

## Building

### Locally

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). To build the site locally, install Ruby (using the version specified in the `.ruby-version` file), and run `bundler` to install the dependencies. If you are on Windows, you must then run these two commands:

```bash
gem uninstall eventmachine
gem install eventmachine --platform ruby
```

### With a Dev Container

Click the green Code button to the top right to open a new codespace with this repository initialized.

### Run dev server

Navigate to the directory where you have cloned `duckdb-web` and run:

```bash
scripts/serve.sh
```

The website can then be browsed by going to `localhost:4000` in your browser.

## Generating code docs

Much of the documentation in this repository is automatically generated from the DuckDB source code or compiled binaries. The scripts that do this work are called from [`scripts/generate_all_docs.sh`](scripts/generate_all_docs.sh).
