## Abstract

DuckDB is a rising newcomer on the block. It has a small footprint, is blazingly fast and runs on all platforms. With its advanced SQL commands, it goes beyond other database engines and offers an interesting feature set. It offers in-memory tables and is optimized for columnar data access, making it ideal for fast data analysis. With its ability to read data from various sources - even directly from cloud storage - it can be used as an ETL tool.
We'll take a quick look at DuckDB and examine how to integrate its power into FileMaker solutions. As an additional benefit you'll learn how to use node.js to create a simple REST API that is instantly accessible with just a few lines of FileMaker script. With this knowledge and a free demo solution you can immediately start your own experiments and harness the power of DuckDB for your own solutions.
Finally, you will gain insight into a complex FileMaker project that would not have been possible without DuckDB.
