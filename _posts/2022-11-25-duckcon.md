**State of the Duck.** Hannes and Mark will talk about recent developments and new features of DuckDB – as well as future plans and goals.

**DuckDB Extensions: The Power of the Sun, in the Palm of My Hand.** DuckDB supports various data scanners (e.g., Parquet, CSV, Arrow, JSON) and (up to now) 543 scalar/aggregation functions. However, domain-specific tasks frequently require specialized scanners and functions. For example, to properly support Geo operations, one must implement intersect functions and be able to scan .shx Shapefiles. In this talk, we will give an overview of how flexible extensions are in DuckDB and demonstrate how users can quickly get started on their own by using our extension scaffolding.

**MotherDuck: What does it take to put DuckDB in the Cloud?** DuckDB is our favorite in-process database for analytics, but what does it mean to be in-process, in the Cloud? In this talk, we will cover how a Cloud-based DuckDB backend can complement your on-laptop DuckDB experience (think collaboration, data reduction, persistence, fast S3 access, and more). We will talk about MotherDuck's architecture, the extensions to DuckDB we had to make, and plans for the future. Expect an engineering-oriented talk with ample opportunity for deep dives.

## Registration

Attendance is free. Please register on our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/duckdb/events/289021740/) since we have a limit on the number of spots.

## Submitting Lightning Talks

We will have a 20-minute slot for lightning talks, where our users are invited to show and tell anything DuckDB-related. Since we have a limited time window, we will have a call for the talks.
