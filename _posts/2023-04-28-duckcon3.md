author: Hannes Mühleisen
excerpt: ""
---

We are excited to hold our first "DuckCon" DuckDB user group meeting outside of Europe in **San Francisco**. The meeting will take place in the afternoon of *June 29th*. The meeting will be held at the [San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)](https://www.sfmoma.org), in the Phyllis Wattis Theater.

In DuckCon #3, we (again) have a talk from DuckDB creators [Hannes Mühleisen](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Mark Raasveldt](https://mytherin.github.io/) about the current state of DuckDB and future plans. Side note: Hannes will also speak at the [Data + AI Summit](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/) earlier that day.

We are also excited to have talks by [Lloyd Tabb](https://twitter.com/lloydtabb), the creator of [Google's Malloy project](https://www.malloydata.dev) and [Josh Wills](https://github.com/jwills), the creator of the [dbt-duckdb](https://github.com/jwills/dbt-duckdb) package.

In addition, we will have several lightning talks from DuckDB users.
