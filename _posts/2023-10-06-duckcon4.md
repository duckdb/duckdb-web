We are excited to hold the next "DuckCon" DuckDB user group meeting for the first time in the birthplace of DuckDB, **Amsterdam**, the Netherlands. The meeting will take place on February 2, 2024 (Friday) in the [OBA Congress Centerâ€™s Theater room](https://www.obacongres.nl/congres-&-beurs), five minutes walking distance from Amsterdam Central Station.

Conveniently, the event is co-located in time and space with the [FOSDEM conference](https://fosdem.org/2024/) that will start the following day in Brussels (February 3-4). Participants could for example choose to attend DuckCon, then take [a direct train from Amsterdam Central Station to Brussels](https://www.thetrainline.com/book/results?origin=urn%3Atrainline%3Ageneric%3Aloc%3A5894&destination=urn%3Atrainline%3Ageneric%3Aloc%3A5974&outwardDate=2024-02-02T18%3A15%3A00&outwardDateType=departAfter&journeySearchType=single&passengers%5B%5D=1996-10-04%7Cd34963f0-4e57-422e-a8be-848783b83a2d&directSearch=false&selectedOutward=C1SRpGy5UVI%3D%3ACwVMIYhanGk%3D%3AStandard).

As is traditional in DuckCons, we will start with a talk from DuckDBâ€™s creators [Hannes MÃ¼hleisen](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Mark Raasveldt](https://mytherin.github.io/) about the current state of DuckDB and plans for releasing DuckDB version 1.0. This will be followed by three presentations by DuckDB users. In addition, we will have several lightning talks from the DuckDB community.
